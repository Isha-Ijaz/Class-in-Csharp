Class and Object in C#

 Definition
1.A class in C# is a blueprint that defines data members and methods.  
2.An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real entity created using that blueprint.

 Relationship Between Class and Object
- A class defines structure and behavior
- An object holds actual data
- Multiple objects can be created from one class
- Objects access class members using the dot (.) operator

Why We Use Class and Object
- To model real world entities
- To organize code in a structured way
- To support object-oriented programming
- To improve code reuse and maintainability

 Simple Example
If Student is a class, then s1 and s2 are objects of the Student class.
